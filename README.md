The Luhn algorithm is a simple checksum formula used to validate identification numbers, primarily credit card numbers.

This simple program checks if a credit card number:
- has 16 digits
- passes the Luhn algorithm
- is recognized by major United States credit card issuers (Visa, Mastercard, Discover, and American Express)
